    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was perusing <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">the paperclip gem’s source code</a> when I came upon the following line (lib/paperclip/interpolations.rb, line 178):</p>

<p><code>ruby
("%09d".freeze % id).scan(/\d{3}/).join("/".freeze)
</code></p>

<p>It’s a useful bit of code for saving attachments to a filesystem, but what struck me immediately was the preponderance of <code>#freeze</code> calls. What the hell is <code>#freeze</code> anyway?</p>

<p>Well, apparently <code>#freeze</code> is relatively common in mature Ruby code. It’s a method of the <code>Object</code> class, and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Object.html#method-i-freeze">“it prevents further modifications” of an object</a>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons you might want to use it.</p>

<h3 id="making-an-object-immutable">1. Making an Object Immutable</h3>

<p>Ruby constants are really just variables that you shouldn’t change. Ruby will warn you if you change a constant, but it won’t raise an exception. So, if you really want to have Ruby enforce the constancy of a constant, you can freeze that object.</p>

<p><code>ruby
JEDI_MASTER = "Kenobi".freeze
JEDI_MASTER.prepend("Rey ") # =&gt; RuntimeError: can't modify frozen String
</code></p>

<p>Remember that when you assign a frozen object to a variable, this does not prevent the variable from being reassigned to another object. The following code, for example, works just fine:</p>

<p><code>ruby
JEDI_MASTER = "Kenobi".freeze
JEDI_MASTER = "Rey Kenobi"
</code></p>

<p>You can extend this to create a whole class of objects that are constant from birth - just call <code>#freeze</code> at the end of a class’s initialize function definition. This might come in handy if you’re <a href="http://blog.honeybadger.io/when-to-use-freeze-and-frozen-in-ruby/">trying to write Ruby in a functional style</a>, or if you need to prevent a programmatically important string (such as a hash key) from being modified by some other code.</p>

<h3 id="performance">2. Performance</h3>

<p>As great as this is, this is not why the paperclip developers used <code>#freeze</code> three times in that line at the beginning of this post.</p>

<p>They used it to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/unraveling-string-key-performance-ruby-2-2/">optimize for performance</a>. Because a frozen object can’t be modified, frozen objects in Ruby are only instantiated a single time for each unique object<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and then retained to be reused in the future. Symbols, fixnums, bignums, and floats are all frozen by default. Strings, however, aren’t, and it’s pretty common for the same string literal - such as the format string in the above example - to be called many, many times in an application.</p>

<p>Therefore, freezing a string literal that you don’t ever intend to modify (such as <code>"/"</code> and the format string <code>"%09d"</code> in the example above) in a method that gets called multiple times can result in substantial memory savings and faster performance. Ruby will allocate those string objects the first time the method is called and then just reference those existing string objects on every subsequent call.</p>

<h2 id="an-immutable-future">An Immutable Future</h2>

<p>For these and other reasons, strings are immutable in several other modern languages, such as Python, Java, C#, and Go, and Ruby is moving in the direction of freezing strings by default, too. Starting with Ruby 2.2, strings used as hash keys are frozen by default, and Ruby 3.0 will freeze all string literals by default. You can see what life is like with frozen string literals right now with the frozen_string_literal pragma, which is <a href="https://blog.blockscore.com/new-features-in-ruby-2-3/">available in Ruby 2.3 or later</a>.</p>

<p>With frozen strings, one can take advantage of the wide array of methods available to String objects without incurring the performance penalty of instantiating loads of identical objects all the time. You can also make use of external libraries, in the form of gems, middleware, or whatever, that might force you to use strings in certain places where you might normally prefer symbols. Symbols, for example, are usually used for hash keys, but some software might expect strings are hash keys. Frozen strings bring many of the benefits of using symbols while maintaining compatibility.</p>

<p>Frozen strings are also a good choice for creating objects based on user input. As Richard Schneeman points out in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/unraveling-string-key-performance-ruby-2-2/">his excellent post about string keys in Ruby 2.0</a>, creating symbols based on user input can lead to a particular sort of denial of service attack and other potential security problems. <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/">The JSON gem suffered from this vulnerability before Ruby 2.0.0</a>, and Mr. Schneeman has some other examples of this vulnerability in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/symbol-gc-ruby-2-2/">his post about symbol garbage collection in Ruby 2.2</a>. Ruby now garbage collects dynamically generated symbols, so this vulnerability isn’t an issue in the latest versions of Ruby, but older versions are common enough that this is still a real concern.</p>

<hr />

<p>Even though Ruby will soon be freezing strings by default, the absolute fastest way to freeze a string is to do it manually. Embrace it. It’s the low-hanging fruit of Ruby optimization. So, when you’ve written an application or a gem or anything in Ruby and you’re looking to speed it up or reduce its memory footprint, look to <code>#freeze</code>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>This is not strictly true in newer versions of Ruby - dynamically generated symbols (created using <code>#to_sym</code>) are garbage collected. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Mr. Schneeman has written <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-uses-memory/">another pretty comprehensive post</a> about <code>#freeze</code> and memory usage that focuses specifically on memory optimization and suggests several tools for profiling your Ruby code for memory usage. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to make a class Enumerable by dynamically mixing in the Enumerable module and defining <code>#each</code> after declaring the class. I failed. This is my story.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was messing around with dynamically mixing in Ruby modules. One of the most useful modules in Ruby is the <code>Enumerable</code> module. It’s a total badass. So I thought I’d try mixing it into a class that I had already defined and see if that worked out.</p>

<p>The first step is including it dynamically. Maybe I can just call the include method on my class!
<code>ruby
MyClass.include(Enumerable)
</code>
Okay! That appears to work. No exceptions. Now let’s use it. I’ll try out using <code>#reduce</code>, one of my favorite higher-order functions in Ruby.
<code>ruby
my_thing = MyClass.new
my_thing.reduce { |thing| puts thing } # =&gt; NoMethodError: undefined method `each' for #&lt;MyClass:0x007fe59c0e3588&gt;
</code>
Oops. In order to take advantage of the Enumerable module, you need both to include the module and <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/2.2.2/Enumerable">define</a> your own <code>#each</code> method.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> This makes a lot of sense - how can your class be enumerable in there’s nothing to enumerate?</p>

<p>I could just define <code>#each</code> in my class definition and be done with it, but this is all about exploring the process of dynamically modifying classes. Let’s just just pretend that doing that is not an option here and we want to add this instance method to the class after it’s been defined.</p>

<p>Defining an instance method for a class after the class definition, however, is pretty awkward. We can’t just use the dot syntax on our class, becuase that would definite our <code>#each</code> for just that one instance of <code>MyClass</code>. The best way to do this is to use <code>#define_method</code>. We can also use <code>Class#class_eval</code>, and it may be preferable from a <a href="http://greyblake.com/blog/2012/09/02/ruby-perfomance-tricks/">performance perspective</a>, but it’s not very readable and unless we absolutely need to squeeze every ounce of performance out of this code, we should probably avoid it. Also, that’s too easy. Let’s make this harder. Let’s use <code>#define_method</code>.</p>

<p>The problem here is that <code>#define_method</code> is a private method that every class inherits from <code>Module</code>. So we can’t just call <code>MyClass.define_method</code>. We have to either create a method in the class definition that in turns calls <code>#define_method</code> for us,

<p>All instances of <code>MyClass</code> will now have our <code>#each</code>. Great. Let’s try using it now!
<code>ruby
my_thing = MyClass.new
my_thing.map { |thing| puts thing } # =&gt; no block given (yield) (LocalJumpError)
</code>
What? <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/LocalJumpError.html">LocalJumpError</a>? No block given? I definitely just passed in a block. What went wrong?</p>

<h3 id="block-as-closures-and-the-behavior-of-yield">Block as Closures and the Behavior of <code>yield</code></h3>

<p>This is where we get into the hairy business of Ruby’s closures. Closures are a bit of a strange concept, especially in the context of object-oriented programming, in which we rely on objects for pretty much everything. Still, it’s worth knowing about closures, Ruby has them, and understanding them will help you in certain other functional or functional hybrid languages, such as JavaScript. Alan Skorkin has <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2010/05/closures-a-simple-explanation-using-ruby/">a nice, succinct definition of closures on his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A closure is basically a function/method that has the following two properties:</p>

  <p>• You can pass it around like an object (to be called later)<br />
• It remembers the values of all the variables that were in scope when the function was created. It is then able to access those variables when it is called even though they may no longer be in scope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recommend Mr. Skorkin’s post about closures. It’s clear and precise and covers both Ruby’s implementation of closures and some common uses of closures. If closures are confusing to you, as they were to me, go ahead and read this post and come back when you’re finished.</p>

<p>Ruby blocks are closures (or at least almost closures - see the second footnote). When you create a block and pass it to a method, it closes over all of the variables and constants in its lexical scope. Here’s the crazy thing: Ruby blocks <em>also close over blocks</em>. They are insane cannibal constructs. So, the problem here is that the yield in the body of my <code>#each</code> is actually yielding to the implicit block (whether it’s passed or not) passed to <code>#create_method</code>. Crazy pants.</p>

<p>As Paul Inning says in <a href="https://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby">his encyclopedic discussion of Ruby closures</a>, “<code>yield</code> can <em>only</em> refer to the block passed to the method it’s in.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> John Mair, creator of our beloved Pry REPL, <a href="https://banisterfiend.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/behavior-of-yield-in-define_method/">believes that this is actually pretty consistent behavior</a>, and that makes sense to me - because blocks close over blocks, any method can receive a block, and a method can handle only one block at a time, <code>yield</code> has to just refer to the block passed to the method in which it finds itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Phew. Okay, fine, I’ll just use <code>Class#class_eval</code>. Or maybe I’ll just actually <code>include Enumerable</code> and define <code>#each</code> like a normal human being.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Also note that (from the Ruby documentation) “If <code>Enumerable#max</code>, <code>#min</code>, or <code>#sort</code> is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>He also says that this means that blocks aren’t true closures - we can’t pass them around. We can only send them to a method and use <code>yield</code> to invoke them. In other words, they’re not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">first-class functions</a>. This is true. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <updated>2015-12-02T21:27:10-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://flats.github.io/blog/2015/12/02/getting-to-know-rubys-map-and-reduce</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <code>#map</code> and <code>#reduce</code> functions are most closely associated with functional programming.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Even so, Ruby, the object-oriented-est of all object-oriented programming languages, has robust implementations of both of these extremely expressive higher-order functions. I’m going to explore how to use these methods and what you can do with them, especially when you use them together. This will be pretty exhaustive, so be prepared for a <em>very</em> long blog post.</p>

<h1 id="first-the-basics">First, the Basics</h1>

<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order functions</a>, each of these methods accepts a function in the form of a block. They then iterate over an enumerable object and call this block on each iteration. Where they differ is in what they do with the result of this block.</p>

<p><code>#map</code> (or <code>#collect</code>) returns an array containing the results of calling the supplied block on each element of the enumerable. In other words, map allows you to apply a function to every element of a data structure and receive the result.</p>

<p><code>#map</code> is usually called with a block, as in <code>collection.map { |element| element + 1 }</code>. If <code>collection = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>, this will return <code>[2, 3, 4, 5]</code>. As with many other methods from the Enumerator module, if <code>#map</code> is called without a block, it will return an Enumerator.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><code>#reduce</code> (or <code>#inject</code>) returns a value that is the result of applying a binary operation to the return value of applying the supplied block to each element of the enumerable. Whoa. What a mouthful. In other words, <code>#reduce</code> “reduces” each element of an enumerable to a single value, accumulates that value in a single variable, and then returns the value of the accumulator. Some functional languages, such Scheme and OCaml, refer to this function as <code>fold</code>.</p>

<p>The simplest use of <code>#reduce</code> is just <code>collection.reduce(initial_value, :name_of_method)</code>. For example,
<code>ruby
array = [1, 2, 3, 4] # =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4]
array.reduce(0, :+) =&gt; 10
</code>
calls the <code>#+</code> for each element in the array. The method that we specify (in this case, <code>#+</code>) has to be a binary method (a method called on one object with a single argument of another object), so we need a starting value, which we have in this case specified as 0. As we iterate through the array using reduce, this is what happens at each stage of the iteration:
<code>ruby
# reduce sets up an accumulator variable, memo, and sets it to the initial
# value, which is 0.
memo = 0
# Now we hit the first element of the array.
memo.send(:+, 1) # =&gt; 1
# The line above is the same as memo += 1 or memo.+(1).
memo.send(:+, 2) # =&gt; 3
memo.send(:+, 3) # =&gt; 6
# This is the last time through the array, so the value of memo at the end
# of this is the return value for reduce.
memo.send(:+, 4) # =&gt; 10
</code>
There’s also the option of passing a block instead of the name of a function, which would look like
<code>ruby
array.reduce(0) { |sum, element| sum + element } # =&gt; 10
</code>
for the example above.</p>

<p>If you don’t declare an initial value, the initial value will be the first element of the collection. This is <em>very</em> important! If, for example, you have an array of objects and you’re using <code>#reduce</code> to get the sum of an attribute, leaving out an initial value will lead to strange and undesirable results.</p>

<h1 id="some-interesting-map-and-reduce-examples">Some Interesting Map and Reduce Examples</h1>

<p>These functions are very powerful when used together. First, I’ll look at a couple of examples of using <code>#map</code> and <code>#reduce</code> on their own, and then I’ll get into an example of using reduce chained on to the end of map.</p>

<h3 id="reduce-as-an-alternative-to-recursion">Reduce as an Alternative to Recursion</h3>

<p>In his <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-techniques-with-ruby-part-i/">series on functional programming in Ruby</a>, Nathan Kleyn mentions a question that Yehuda Katz asked several years ago about splitting a module name in a particular way.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> <a href="http://rubyquicktips.com/post/1018776470/embracing-functional-programming">One solution proposed by Bradley Grzesiak</a> demonstrates a particularly interesting use of <code>#reduce</code> (or, as in this case, <code>#inject</code>:
<code>ruby
module_name = "X::Y::Z"
module_name.split('::').inject([]) { |memo,x| memo.unshift(memo.empty? ? x : "#{memo[0]}::#{x}") }
=&gt; ["X::Y::Z", "X::Y", "X"]
</code>
Let’s break this not-quite-recursive code down into separate steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Mr. Grzesiak splits <code>module_name</code>, which is our starting string, on the scope resolution operator into the array [“X”, “Y”, “Z”].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then uses <code>#inject</code> with the <code>inject(initial)</code> syntax, which will initialize the accumulator, called <code>memo</code>, to an empty array.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the iteration begins. If this new ‘memo’ array is empty, which will only happen on the first iteration of <code>#inject</code>, <code>#inject</code> adds that element (“X”) to the beginning of <code>memo</code> (using <code>Array#unshift</code>). Otherwise, <code>#inject</code> adds a string to <code>memo</code> containing the result of the previous iteration (“X”), the separator (“::”), and the current element (“Y”).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, the final array is built backwards: [“X”], then [“X::Y”, “X”], and then finally [“X::Y::Z”, “X::Y”, “X”]. Nifty. There’s a recursive solution to this problem, but it’s not nearly as clear and concise. This is a great example of how higher-order functions can be used as an alternative to recursion.</p>

There’s nothing too remarkable about this method and its use of map, but I’m going to break it down because it’s a good example of <code>#map</code> in some very widely used code. This code is proobably executing somewhere at this very moment.</p>

<p>As the comment says, this method <code>format_paragraph</code> takes a chunk of text that needs formatting, a line length that defaults to 72, and an indent length (in spaces) that defatuls to 2. There are two steps to this process: first break the text into lines, and then indent each line by the specified indent size.</p>

<p>In the first step, our function creates an array of arrays <code>sentences</code>, each array of which comprises the strings that make up each line. The combined character count of the words in each of these nested arrays is not greater than the specified line length (<code>len</code>).</p>

<p>The second step is where we use map to add the proper indentation to each line. After building up the indentation as a string of whitespace using <code>String#*</code>, our function mutates the array of line arrays by using <code>#map!</code> to join the words with a space (rebuild then sentence) and prepend the indentation spaces. Then the lines are all joined with line breaks. Now we have a formatted paragraph.</p>

<p>Haitham Mohammad put <code>#transpose</code> <a href="http://rubyquicktips.com/post/18842314838/some-array-magic-using-transpose-map-and-reduce">through its paces</a> on <a href="http://rubyquicktips.com/">Ruby Quicktips</a>, the same site that gave us the above solution. <code>#transpose</code>, <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-transpose">according to the Ruby documentation</a>, “assumes that self is an array of arrays and transposes the rows and columns.” In other words, if you imagine an array of arrays as rows in a table, <code>#transpose</code> will return the columns from that table.</p>

<p>Mr. Mohammad then shows us how to get the sum of each column of table represented by an array of row arrays.

<p>So there’s a bit about <code>#map</code> and <code>#reduce</code>. There’s a lot more to discuss - for example, these methods <a href="http://yeungda.com/2011/11/01/ruby-lambda-keyword.html">can take lambdas, too!</a> - but this is already a very long post.</p>

<p>I love these guys.</p>
